Yeah, but then I'd have to remember _exactly_ which confs I'd modified and they're not all in /etc either... > Thats what I would do, but you sysadmins have to make life as difficult & > complicated as possible ;--) Yup... In this case, I had two issues. 1. I mirrored the disk to give to someone else to work on but the box he has available has only a P1 or P2 processor. 2. My celeron box has been crashing the backup software so I wanted to try out the backup in a different box to make sure it's hardware related. Again, it's also an interesting exercise... > Have you thought about mirroring the system drives? Might save you serious > hassle down the line. Oh, I'm doing that too. This is going to Africa so I'm aiming for as robust as possible with belt, braces and probably an all-in-one jumpsuit! I'll be mirroring the disk but that is worth only so much (eg. lightning strike taking out the disk(s) or system compromise) I'm also going for a backup to CDR with an automated restore http://www.mondorescue.org . The admin out there wouldn't be able to build the system again if the mobo got fried and the replacement was the wrong arch but an i386 compatible install will mean just dropping in the HD and booting (ish)...
